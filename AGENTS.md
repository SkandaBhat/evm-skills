# EVM Skills Agent Instructions

Canonical project documentation is in `docs/`.

Before finishing any task with new technical facts, constraints, or decisions:
1. Update the relevant file in `docs/learnings/` or `docs/plans/`.
2. Add a dated note to `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Ensure `docs/README.md` links to the new or updated content.

Repository direction:
1. Keep the skill JSON-RPC-only.
2. Do not add alternate CLI fallbacks.
3. Remove obsolete docs/files when they no longer reflect the current architecture.

Primary entry points:
- `docs/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/README.md`
